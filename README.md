## Tipalti React Starter Template

This is a simplified React starter templateconfigured using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience.

It has minimal dependencies and configuration to allow for easy installation and to allow the candidate to make their own decisions about styling, external libraries and other tooling.

You are free to make changes to the template but please be aware that those reviewing your work will need to be able to install and run it locally without difficulty.

### Note

If given more time, I would like to do the following:

- The table doesn't match as how it's displaying in the requirement.If given time, I would like to display the table as how it's showing in the actual UI.
- Adding more tests
- Adding form field for `user first` and `last name` so that we don't have to hard code the headers when making API request.
